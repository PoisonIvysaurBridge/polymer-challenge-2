# polymer-challenge-2 for WEBTECH class
A mini polymer challenge from WEBTECH class that implements the Building and Image Carousel App in Polymer 2.0 tutorial (codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/polymer-2-carousel) and extends with more features such as letting the user upload images and their descriptions to the carousel app.

General Instructions: Using the image carousel application as your second Polymer application, you are to create your own customized image carousel application with additional features. Your grade is dependent on the number of features you have for your custom image carousel application. 

Specific Instructions:
1.   A features checklist is provided for you in the next section. This will serve as your guide on what features you need to implement. Aim for the perfect score!
2.   You are only allowed to use Javascript, jQuery, Polymer and any custom elements in the Web Components website. 
3.   You are free to talk to your seatmates, discuss how to implement this, but you should create the code on your own.
